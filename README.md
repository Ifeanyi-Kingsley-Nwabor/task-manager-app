This project was bootstrapped with Create React App for the frontend and Express generator for the Nodejs backend.

This is a simple 3- tier web application which can be used to schedule activities. The application consists of a Frontend React application, Backend (Node js, Express js) and a Relational database - PostgreSQL.

Next steps

This application was created without any tests.
For this application to be production ready,

Tests (Unit and Integration tests) should be written for both the Frontend and Backend application.

Form input validation should also be implemented.
Look out for security loopholes:
 example
User sends html and script tags through the form input fields which might contain malicious codes that could disrupt the database.
It is essential to lookout for potential security threats and endeavour to mitigate them.
